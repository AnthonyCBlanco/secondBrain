### Idea

**Conic sections** can be represented in **polar form**, with the focus at the **pole** (origin). These forms are especially useful when analyzing or graphing conics centered around a point rather than along a Cartesian axis.

#### General Form of a Polar Conic

The general equation for a conic section in polar coordinates is:

$$
r = \frac{ep}{1 \pm e\cos\theta} \quad \text{or} \quad r = \frac{ep}{1 \pm e\sin\theta}
$$

Where:
- $e$ is the **eccentricity**
- $p$ is the **distance from the focus to the directrix**
- The $\pm$ sign determines the orientation
- Use $\cos\theta$ for **horizontal** orientation  
- Use $\sin\theta$ for **vertical** orientation

#### What is Eccentricity?

The **eccentricity** $e$ tells you what type of conic you're working with:

| Conic Type      | Eccentricity $e$ |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Circle          | $e = 0$          |
| Ellipse         | $0 < e < 1$      |
| Parabola        | $e = 1$          |
| Hyperbola       | $e > 1$          |

#### Examples

**1. Circle (special case of ellipse)**  
$r = \frac{p}{1 + 0\cos\theta} = p$ → A constant radius  

---

**2. Ellipse**  
$r = \frac{ep}{1 + e\cos\theta}$ where $0 < e < 1$  
- Graph is a stretched circle, centered at the pole  


---

**3. Parabola**  
$r = \frac{p}{1 + \cos\theta}$ where $e = 1$  
- Focus is at the pole  
- Directrix is a line perpendicular to the direction of $\theta = 0$  


---

**4. Hyperbola**  
$r = \frac{ep}{1 - e\cos\theta}$ where $e > 1$  
- Two branches extending away from the pole  

---

#### Tips for Graphing

- Identify $e$ and determine the conic type.
- Determine if $\cos\theta$ (horizontal) or $\sin\theta$ (vertical) is used.
- Use symmetry to help sketch (many polar conics are symmetric about the polar axis or line $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$).
- Note that $p$ does not directly give radius—it’s related to the directrix.
