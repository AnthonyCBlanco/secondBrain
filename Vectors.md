### Idea
Quantities that involve both magnitude and a direction are called **vector quantities**, or vectors for short
Quantities that involve magnitude, but no direction, are called scalar quantities, or scalars for short | *scalars are just real numbers*

#### Directed Line Segments
A line segments which a direction has been assigned is called a directed line segment. We call P the initial point and Q the terminal point. We denote this directed line segment by $|\vec{PQ}|$  or we can call it $\vec{|w|}$ which is a vector
*When we use the absolute value bars to denote the magnitude*

Vector are equal when both the magnitude and direction are the same 

We can use the [[Distance Formula]] to find the length of a vector
$||\vec{u}|| =\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2 +(y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$ 

##### Solving an equality of two vectors
You can find the distance of each line segment and see if each are equal

Show magnitude by distance formula
Slope: $m=\frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}$ 


##### Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
The multiplication of a real number *k* and a $\vec{v}$ is called scalar multiplication. We write is product $k \vec{v}$ 

Multiplying a vector only changes the magnitude of the vector not the direction.
$[0,1)$ the magnitude is getting smaller
$(1, \infty)$ the magnitude is getting larger
