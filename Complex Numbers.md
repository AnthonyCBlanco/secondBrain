### Idea

**Complex Numbers** are numbers with both real and imaginary parts

The imaginary unit $i$ is defined as
$i = \sqrt{ -1 }$ , where $i^2=-1$ 

In **standard form** $a+bi$ is a complex number, where ***a*** and **b*** are real numbers, however **b*** is the imaginary part of the number.
$$
a+bi 
$$
Complex number are known as **closed** in [[Number Theory]]
	Where any operations on a complex number will **ALWAYS** result in a complex number

##### Arithmetic on Complex Numbers
When preforming arithmetic on complex number, we can only preform such on corresponding parts of the number
	Formally, *we can only add the real parts to other real parts, and imaginary parts with imaginary parts*

Even when multiplying **complex numbers** it is the same.
	Remember that $i^2 =-1$, thus when multiplying complex numbers and you get a $i^2$ you must simplify it as $-1$ 
	Basically when a number is being multiplied $i^2$ you flip the sign

It's literally just combining like terms. just how you cant combine $a+b$ its the same with imaginary where $i^2=-1$

###### Complex Conjugates
The out come of a complex conjugates is just its real parts squared
$$
(a+bi)(a-bi)=a^2+b^2
$$
When dividing complex numbers we can not have imaginary numbers on the bottom, just like how we rationalize denominators in fractions
$$\begin{gather}
\frac{2+3i}{3-5i} \\
\frac{2+3i}{3-5i} * \frac{3+5i}{3+5i} \\ \\
\text{This simplify to: }
\frac{-9}{34}+\frac{19}{34}i
\end{gather}

$$
Make sure you split the fraction so the real parts are separate from the imaginary parts 

##### Principal Square Root of a Negative Number
 For and positive real number *b*, the **principal** square root of the negative number $-b$ is defined by $\sqrt{ -b }= i \sqrt{ b }$ 

### Formally

##### Arithmetic on Complex Numbers

$$
(a+bi)+(c+di)=(a-c)+(b-d)i
$$
