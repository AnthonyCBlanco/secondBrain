### Idea

The **difference quotient** is a formula that gives the **average rate of change** of a function over an interval. It is foundational in calculus because it leads directly to the **definition of the derivative**.

---

### Formula

The difference quotient of a function $$f(x)$$ is defined as:

$$
\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

- This expression measures the **average rate of change** between $$x$$ and $$x + h$$.
- As $$h \to 0$$the difference quotient becomes the **instantaneous rate of change**, also known as the **derivative**.

### Visual Meaning

The difference quotient represents the **slope of the secant line** connecting the points:

- $$(x, f(x))$$  
- $$(x + h, f(x + h))$$

As $$h$$ becomes smaller, this secant line approaches the **tangent line** at $$x$$.

---

### Example

Given $$f(x) = x^2$$, find the difference quotient:

$$
\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
= \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}
= \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h}
= \frac{2xh + h^2}{h}
= 2x + h
$$

As $$h \to 0$$, the expression approaches $$2x$$, which is the **derivative** of $$x^2$$.

### Why It Matters

- Helps introduce the **concept of a derivative**
- Used in **physics** for velocity/acceleration
- Shows **how functions change** over small intervals
