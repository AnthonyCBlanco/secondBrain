### Idea

[[Logarithms]] are the **inverses of exponential functions**. That means:

$$
\log_b(a) = x \quad \text{means} \quad b^x = a
$$

Where:
- $b$ is the base (must be positive and not equal to 1)
- $a$ is the argument
- $x$ is the exponent

### Rules of Logarithms

Use these identities to simplify, expand, or solve logarithmic expressions:

---

#### 1. Product Rule

$$
\log_b(MN) = \log_b(M) + \log_b(N)
$$

→ The log of a product is the **sum** of the logs.

---

#### 2. Quotient Rule

$$
\log_b\left(\frac{M}{N}\right) = \log_b(M) - \log_b(N)
$$

→ The log of a quotient is the **difference** of the logs.

---

#### 3. Power Rule

$$
\log_b(M^k) = k \cdot \log_b(M)
$$

→ The exponent comes **out front**.

---

#### 4. Change of Base Formula

$$
\log_b(M) = \frac{\log_k(M)}{\log_k(b)}
$$

→ You can convert any log base to another.  
Common version:  
$$
\log_b(M) = \frac{\ln M}{\ln b} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\log M}{\log b}
$$

---

#### 5. Inverse Properties

- $b^{\log_b(x)} = x$
- $\log_b(b^x) = x$

→ These "undo" each other.

---

### Quick Tips

- $\log(xy)$ is **not** equal to $\log x \cdot \log y$
- $\log(x + y)$ **cannot** be simplified
- Always check the domain: $\log_b(x)$ is only defined for $x > 0$
