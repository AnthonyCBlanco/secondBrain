### Idea

A **system of equations** is a set of two or more equations involving the same variables. The goal is to find values that satisfy **all equations** in the system.

### Types of Systems

#### 1. **Linear Systems**
All equations are linear (e.g., $y = 2x + 3$).  
Most common systems are:
- 2 equations with 2 variables
- 3 equations with 3 variables

#### 2. **Nonlinear Systems**
At least one equation is nonlinear (e.g., circles, parabolas).  
→ [[Nonlinear Systems]]

### Solutions

- **One solution** → The system is **consistent and independent**.  
- **No solution** → The system is **inconsistent** (parallel lines).  
- **Infinitely many solutions** → The system is **dependent** (same line or plane).

→ [[Types of Solutions in Systems]]

### Solving Methods

#### 1. **Graphing**
Plot all equations and find the point(s) of intersection.

→ [[Graphing Linear Systems]]

#### 2. **Substitution**
Solve one equation for a variable, then substitute into the other.

→ [[Solving Systems by Substitution]]

#### 3. **Elimination (Addition)**
Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable.

→ [[Solving Systems by Elimination]]

#### 4. **Matrix Methods**
Use matrix representations to solve (Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination).

→ [[Matrices and Row Operations]]

### Example (2×2 System)


$$
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 6 \\
2x - y &= 3
\end{aligned}
$$


Solve by:
- **Substitution**: Solve first equation for $y = 6 - x$, then plug into the second.
- **Elimination**: Add the two equations to eliminate $y$.
