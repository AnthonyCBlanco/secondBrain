### Idea

In a polar coordinate system, we plot point in terms of radius and degrees.

***Each Ring represents one Radii and one full rotation is 2$\pi$***

If we are asked to transfer polar cords to rectangular cords we can you the following conversation

$$
\begin{gather}
x=r\cos\theta \\
y=r\sin\theta \\
x^2+y^2=r^2 \\
\tan\theta=\frac{y}{x} \text{ | Be Sure to check were the point terminates}
\end{gather}
$$

##### Polar Equation

A **polar equation** is an equation whose variables are *r* and $\theta$ 

To convert a rectangular equation in *x* and *y* to a polar
equation in *r* and $\theta$, replace x with r and $r\cos \theta$ and y with $r\sin\theta$ 

***Just replace x and y***
