# Friction

### Idea
There are two main types of frictional forces:

- **Static Friction ($f_s$)** — friction when an object is *not moving*  
- **Kinetic Friction ($f_k$)** — friction when an object is *in motion*

Friction is the resistive force that **opposes relative motion** (or attempted motion) between two surfaces in contact.

### Static Friction

Static friction acts when an object is **stationary**.  
The force required to start moving an object is usually **greater** than the force needed to keep it moving once it starts.

At the threshold of motion, static friction reaches its **maximum value**:

$$
f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s N
$$

Where:
- $\mu_s$ = coefficient of static friction  
- $N$ = normal force (the perpendicular contact force)

$$
\mu_{s}= \frac{ f_s^{\text{max}}}{N}
$$

Once the applied force exceeds $f_s^{\text{max}}$, the object begins to move — this marks the transition to **kinetic friction**.

> Think of $f_s^{\text{max}}$ as the *minimum* amount of force needed to get the object moving (i.e., to overcome inertia).

### Kinetic Friction

Once an object is sliding, the frictional force becomes **kinetic friction**:

$$
f_k = \mu_k N
$$

Where:
- $\mu_k$ = coefficient of kinetic friction (typically $\mu_k < \mu_s$)

Kinetic friction usually remains **constant** in magnitude and **opposes the direction of motion**.

### Comparing Static and Kinetic Friction

| Type | Symbol | Equation | Description |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Static Friction** | $f_s$ | $f_s \leq \mu_s N$ | Varies in response to applied force until motion begins |
| **Maximum Static Friction** | $f_s^{\text{max}}$ | $f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s N$ | Threshold before motion occurs |
| **Kinetic Friction** | $f_k$ | $f_k = \mu_k N$ | Constant once the object is moving |

### Example

A 10 kg box rests on a horizontal floor.  
Coefficients of friction are $\mu_s = 0.5$ and $\mu_k = 0.3$.  
Find the minimum horizontal force required to start moving the box.

**Step 1:** Find the normal force  
$$
N = mg = (10)(9.8) = 98 \text{ N}
$$

**Step 2:** Find the maximum static friction  
$$
f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s N = 0.5(98) = 49 \text{ N}
$$

✅ **Answer:** The applied force must exceed **49 N** to start motion.

Once moving, the frictional force drops to:  
$$
f_k = \mu_k N = 0.3(98) = 29.4 \text{ N}
$$

### Factors Affecting Friction
- Nature of surfaces in contact (roughness, texture)
- Normal force magnitude
- Surface area **does not** significantly affect friction (contrary to intuition)
- Presence of lubricants (reduces friction)
