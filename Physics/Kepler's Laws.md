# Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

### Idea
Kepler’s Laws describe the motion of planets and other orbiting bodies around the Sun.  
They were derived empirically from Tycho Brahe’s astronomical data and later explained theoretically by Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation.

Kepler’s three laws describe:
1. **The shape of orbits**  
2. **How fast planets move in different parts of their orbit**  
3. **The relationship between orbital period and distance from the Sun**

These laws apply to any object orbiting under gravity, not just planets: moons, satellites, comets, and binary star systems.

### Kepler’s First Law — *The Law of Orbits*
**Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus.**

- An **ellipse** is a closed curve defined by two foci.  
- The distance from a point on the ellipse to each focus satisfies:  
  $$
  r_1 + r_2 = \text{constant}
  $$
- The Sun is **not** at the center of the ellipse—only at **one focus**.

**Key Geometry Terms**
- **Semi-major axis**: longest radius of the ellipse  
- **Semi-minor axis**: shortest radius  
- **Eccentricity** $e$ measures “stretch” of the ellipse:  
  - $e = 0$ → perfect circle  
  - $0 < e < 1$ → ellipse

### Kepler’s Second Law — *The Law of Areas*
**A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.**

This means:
- A planet moves **faster** when it is **closer** to the Sun (perihelion).  
- A planet moves **slower** when it is **farther** from the Sun (aphelion).  

Mathematically:
- The **areal velocity** is constant:  
  $$
  \frac{dA}{dt} = \text{constant}
  $$

This law expresses **conservation of angular momentum**, which is a fundamental principle in physics.

### Kepler’s Third Law — *The Harmonic Law*
**The square of a planet’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.**

In formula form:

$$
T^2 \propto a^3
$$

Or more precisely (for planets around the Sun):

$$
\frac{T^2}{a^3} = \text{constant}
$$

Where:
- $T$ = orbital period  
- $a$ = semi-major axis  

For any planet around the same star, the ratio is the same.

### Example

Suppose a planet has a semi-major axis of  
$$
a = 4 \text{ AU}
$$

Use Kepler’s Third Law:  
$$
T^2 = a^3 = 4^3 = 64
$$

So the orbital period is:  
$$
T = \sqrt{64} = 8 \text{ years}
$$

### Concept Summary

- **First Law:** Orbits are ellipses, not circles.  
- **Second Law:** Planets change speed—fast near the Sun, slow farther away.  
- **Third Law:** Distant planets take much longer to orbit.

These laws form the foundation of celestial mechanics and are essential for understanding orbital motion, satellites, and gravitational physics.
