# Universal Gravitation

### Idea
Universal gravitation describes the attractive force that exists between any two masses in the universe. This force governs planetary motion, satellite orbits, tides, and many large-scale astronomical phenomena.

---

### Definition
Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation states that every two point masses attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

$$F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

Where:
- $F_g$ = gravitational force  
- $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11}\ \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2$  
- $m_1, m_2$ = masses  
- $r$ = distance between centers of mass

### Important Concepts

#### 1. Gravitational Field
A mass $M$ creates a gravitational field:

$$g = \frac{F_g}{m} = G\frac{M}{r^2}$$

---

#### 2. Weight
The weight of an object near a planet of mass $M$ and radius $R$:

$$W = mg = G\frac{Mm}{R^2}$$

---

#### 3. Gravitational Potential Energy
The gravitational potential energy of a mass $m$ at distance $r$ from a mass $M$:

$$U = -G\frac{Mm}{r}$$

---

#### 4. Circular Orbital Velocity
For a satellite orbiting a body of mass $M$ at radius $r$:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$

---

#### 5. Escape Velocity
Minimum speed required to escape a gravitational field:

$$v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$

---

#### 6. Kepler’s Third Law (Newtonian Form)
Relates orbital period $T$ to orbital radius $r$ around mass $M$:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} r^3$$

---

### Examples

#### Example 1: Gravitational Force on a 10 kg Object Near Earth
Given $M = 5.97 \times 10^{24}\ \text{kg}$ and $R = 6.371 \times 10^{6}\ \text{m}$:

$$F_g = G \frac{(5.97 \times 10^{24})(10)}{(6.371 \times 10^6)^2} \approx 98\ \text{N}$$

---

#### Example 2: Escape Velocity From Earth
$$v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} \approx 11{,}200\ \text{m/s}$$

---

### Concept Summary
- Gravity is an attractive inverse-square force between masses.  
- $g = G\frac{M}{r^2}$ describes gravitational field strength.  
- Orbital motion, tides, and planetary dynamics arise from gravitational interactions.  
- Escape velocity depends only on the mass of the central body and distance from its center.  
- Newton’s version of Kepler’s Third Law connects orbital radius and period.
