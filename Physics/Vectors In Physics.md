### Idea

[[Vectors]] in physics are the same as vectors studied in trigonometry and pre-calculus. In physics, many physical quantities are expressed as vectors—such as **velocity** or **acceleration**—because they require both a **magnitude** and a **direction**.  

In contrast, **scalars** are quantities that only require magnitude and have no direction (e.g., time, mass, speed).

### Examples of Scalar Quantities
- Length  
- Time  
- Speed  
- Mass  
- Distance  
- Work  
- Energy  

### Examples of Vector Quantities
- Force  ($\vec{F}$)
- Displacement  
- Velocity ($\vec{v}$) 
- Acceleration ($\vec{a}$)  
- Momentum  ($\vec{P}$)
- Torque  ($T$)
- Electric Field
- Angular Momentum ($\vec{L}$)

### Formally

- A **scalar** is a physical quantity described by a single value (with units).  
- A **vector** is a physical quantity described by both a magnitude and a direction.  


#### Velocity

Velocity ($\vec{v}$) $\implies \text{speed} \implies \text{magnitude of velocity}$
> Speed Is the magnitude of a velocity vector
