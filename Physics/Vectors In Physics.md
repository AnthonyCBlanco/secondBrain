### Idea

[[Vectors]] in physics are the same as vectors studied in trigonometry and pre-calculus. In physics, many physical quantities are expressed as vectors—such as **velocity** or **acceleration**—because they require both a **magnitude** and a **direction**.  

In contrast, **scalars** are quantities that only require magnitude and have no direction (e.g., time, mass, speed).

### Formally

- A **scalar** is a physical quantity described by a single value (with units).  
- A **vector** is a physical quantity described by both a magnitude and a direction.
