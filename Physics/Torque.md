# Torque (τ)

Torque is the rotational analogue of force. It measures how effectively a force causes an object to rotate about a pivot or axis.

## 🌟 Definition

Torque is defined by the cross product of the position vector $\vec{r}$ (pivot → point of force application) and the force $ \vec{F} $:

$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}
$$

The magnitude of torque:

$$
\tau = rF \sin(\theta)
$$

Where:
- $r$: distance from pivot  
- $F$: applied force  
- $\theta$: angle between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$

## ⚙️ Units

- **Newton-meters (N·m)**
- Not equivalent to Joules, even though units match.

---

## 🎯 Sign Convention

- **Positive torque** → counterclockwise  
- **Negative torque** → clockwise  

Right-hand rule:  
Curl your fingers from $\vec{r}$ to $\vec{F}$; thumb = torque direction.

## 📘 Torque and Rotational Motion

Newton’s Second Law for rotation:

$$
\vec{\tau}_{\text{net}} = I\vec{\alpha}
$$

Where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\alpha$ is angular acceleration.

## 🔩 Lever Arm and Components

Torque using perpendicular component of force:

$$
\tau = F_{\perp} r
$$

Where:

$$
F_{\perp} = F \sin(\theta)
$$

## 📐 Vector Form (Cross Product)

Full vector form:

$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}
$$

Magnitude:

$$
\tau = r F \sin(\theta)
$$

## 🌀 Relationship to Angular Momentum

Torque is the time derivative of angular momentum $\vec{L}$:

$$
\vec{\tau} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}
$$

## 🪨 Static Equilibrium Condition

For an object to remain in rotational equilibrium:

$$
\sum \tau = 0
$$

Both **net torque** and **net force** must be zero in full equilibrium.
