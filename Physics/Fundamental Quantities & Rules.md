#### Unit Conversations

Just like [[Conversion Of Degrees to Radians]] the unit of measure you want to covert from goes on the denotator of tehe fraction and the 1-1 conversation on the unit you need to convert to. For example converting 100km to miles: 

> We know that 1 mile is equal to ~1.6 km so we put that in the denotator

$$
100km \times \frac{1\text{mile}}{1.6\text{km}} = (\text{the conversion in miles})
$$
#### Significant Figures

A significant figure is one that is reliably now digit
	Zeros may or may not be significant
		- Those used to position the decimal point are not significant
		- To remove ambiguity, use scientific notation
In a measurement, the significant figures include the first estimated digit
	When estimating data or measurements only include the first estimated digit
