# Newton’s Laws of Motion & Force

### Idea

**Force**: An interaction that causes a change in the state of motion of an object.  

Types of fundamental forces in nature:  
- Gravitational Force  
- Electromagnetic Force  
- Strong Nuclear Force  
- Weak Nuclear Force

### Types of Forces

#### Contact Force
A force that arises from **physical contact** between two objects.  
Examples: friction, tension, normal force, applied push/pull.  

See also → [[Motion In One Dimension]], [[Motion in Two Dimensions]]  

#### Field Force
A force that acts **at a distance** through space, without physical contact.  
Examples: gravity, electric force, magnetic force.

### Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)

> An object will remain at rest, or in uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by a net external force.

- Defines the concept of **inertia**: the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion.  
- Introduces the **inertial reference frame**: a reference frame in which Newton’s laws are valid (non-accelerating frame).

### The Law of Inertia
- Inertia is the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion.  
- The greater the mass, the greater the inertia.  

---

### Newton’s Second Law

The net force on an object is proportional to its acceleration, and the constant of proportionality is the object’s mass:

$$
\vec{F}_{net} = m \vec{a}
$$

Where:  
- $\vec{F}_{net}$ = net force (N)  
- $m$ = mass (kg)  
- $\vec{a}$ = acceleration (m/s$^2$)

This is the **fundamental equation of dynamics**.  

See also → [[The Derivative]] (since $a = \frac{dv}{dt}$ and $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$)

### Newton’s Third Law

> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

- Forces always come in **action–reaction pairs**.  
- If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on object A:  

$$
\vec{F}_{AB} = - \vec{F}_{BA}
$$

---

### Mass

- **Mass measures inertia.**  
- Ratio definition:  
  For two objects with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ under the same force $F$:  

  $$
  \frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
  $$

- Mass is **inherent** to a body and does not depend on its location or environment.  

---

### Weight

- **Weight** is the **force of gravity** acting on a mass:  

$$
\vec{W} = m \vec{g}
$$

Where:  
- $m$ = mass (kg)  
- $\vec{g}$ = acceleration due to gravity (≈ $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ near Earth’s surface)  

- **Mass vs Weight**:  
  - Mass: scalar, intrinsic, constant everywhere.  
  - Weight: vector, depends on location (changes with gravitational field).

### Force As Vectors

- The combined effect of two collinear forces are equal to the sum of the individual forces
### Summary

- **First Law** → defines inertia and inertial reference frames.  
- **Second Law** → relates force, mass, and acceleration.  
- **Third Law** → forces occur in equal and opposite pairs.  
- **Mass** → intrinsic measure of inertia.  
- **Weight** → gravitational force acting on mass.
