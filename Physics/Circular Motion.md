# Uniform Circular Motion

### Idea

A particle moving in a circular path of **radius** $r$ with **constant speed** $v$ experiences an **acceleration directed toward the center** of the circle.  
This acceleration is known as **centripetal acceleration** (meaning *center-seeking*).

---

### Centripetal Acceleration

The magnitude of the acceleration is given by:

$$
a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Even though the **speed** is constant, the **velocity vector** continuously changes direction — this change in direction causes **acceleration**.

---

### Applying Newton’s Second Law

If the particle is attached to a string (like a ball on a string), the **tension** in the string provides the **centripetal force**.

Applying Newton’s Second Law along the radial direction:

$$
\sum F_r = T = m a_c = m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Here:
- $T$ = tension (central force)
- $m$ = mass of the object  
- $v$ = linear speed  
- $r$ = radius of the circular path  

> Note: Gravity and the normal force cancel out if the motion is horizontal.

### Velocity in Circular Motion

Velocity is **always tangent** to the path of motion.

Instantaneous velocity:

$$
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
$$

Average velocity over an interval:

$$
\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}
$$

The **direction of $\vec{v}$** is always **perpendicular to $\vec{r}$**.

---

### Angular Displacement and Arc Length

The **rotation of $\vec{r}$** corresponds to the **rotation of $\vec{v}$** by the same angle $\Delta \theta$.

The **arc length** $s$ between two positions is given by:

$$
s = r \, \Delta \theta
$$

Thus, $\Delta \theta = \frac{s}{r}$

> This shows how angular displacement relates linear motion ($s$) to rotational motion ($\theta$).

---

### Centripetal Acceleration (Vector Form)

For uniform circular motion, $\Delta \vec{v}$ is always directed **toward the center** of the circle.  
Thus, the acceleration vector points inward:

$$
\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
$$

This is what keeps the particle moving in a **circular path** instead of flying off in a straight line (as it would without the inward force).

---

### Frequency and Period

In uniform circular motion, the **period** ($T$) is the **time it takes to complete one full revolution**,  
and the **frequency** ($f$) is the **number of revolutions per second**.

They are inversely related:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

#### Relation to Linear Speed
The distance traveled in one revolution is the **circumference** of the circle, $2\pi r$.  
Since one revolution takes time $T$, the linear speed $v$ is:

$$
v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$

Combining these two equations gives:

$$
v = 2\pi r f
$$

---

### Angular Velocity Connection

The **angular velocity** $\omega$ measures how fast the object rotates (radians per second):

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f
$$

and the relationship between linear and angular speed is:

$$
v = \omega r
$$
