### Idea

>Coterminal Angles are angles that terminate in the same position as Theta. Finding coterminal angles are essential for calculations that require a certain interval of degrees or radians to be considered

### Formally

$$
\text{Let } \Theta = 720\degree
$$
>Say we need an angle to be between 0 - 360 [[Angles and Radian Measure Basics|Degrees]]
>We can add or subtract one full rotation the find a coterminal angle
$$
\theta  - 360\degree = 360\degree
$$
>We can also do this in [[Angles and Radian Measure Basics|Radians]]
$$
\text{Let } \Theta = \frac{18\pi}{3}
$$

>We can keep subtracting  full rotations until we have a coterminal angle between

$$
\Theta - \frac{6\pi}{3} = \frac{12\pi}{3}
$$

$$
\frac{12\pi}{3}-\frac{6\pi}{3}=\frac{6\pi}{3}
$$
