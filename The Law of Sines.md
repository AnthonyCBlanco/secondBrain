### Idea

We can use [[The Law of Sines]] or [[The Law of Cosines]] to solve [[Oblique Triangles]] triangles.

The Law of Sines States that 

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C} 
$$
or

$$
\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b}=\frac{\sin C}{c}
$$
__We can use this for any oblique triangle__ 

The ratio of the length of the side of any triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle
