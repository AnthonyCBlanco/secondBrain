[[Truth Values]]

An argument is a sequence of statements aimed at demonstrating the truth of an assertion

The assertion at the end of the sequence is call the *conclusion* and the preceding statements are called *premises*

In logic, the form of an argument is distinguished form its content/ Logical analysis won't help you determine the intrinsic merit of an argument's content, but it will help you analyze an argument's from to determine whether the truth of the conclusion follows necessary from the truth of the premises.

For the reason logic is sometimes defined as the science of necessary inference or the science of reasoning

### Formally

$$\mathrm{If}\overbrace{\text{ the bell rings}}^{p}\mathrm{~or}\overbrace{\text{ the flag drops}}^{q},\mathrm{~then}\overbrace{\text{ the race is over}}^{r}
$$
$$

\therefore\mathrm{If}\overbrace{\text{ the race is not over}}^{\mathrm{not~}r},\text{then }\overbrace{\mathrm{ the~bell~hasn^{\prime}t~rung}}^{\mathrm{not~}p}\mathrm{~and~}\overbrace{\mathrm{the~flag~hasn^{\prime}t~dropped}}^{\mathrm{not~}q}.$$

To help make this clear, we use letter like *p, q, and r* to represent component sentences; we let the expression "not p" refer to the sentence "It is not the case that p"; and we let the three dots $\therefore$ refer to *therefore*
