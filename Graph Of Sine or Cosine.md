### Idea
Best way to graph a *sine* is to find five points of one **cycle** by finding the amplitude, period, and interval for one complete **cycle**

One **cycle** of is one full **period**
The *amplitude* = **1** *the distance between the minimum and maximum*
The *period* = 2$\pi$
The domain = $(-\infty, \infty)$
The range = $[-1, 1]$ 
The range = the amplitude

For whole multiples of $\pi$  $y =\sin x\text{; always} = 0$  if there is no [[Phase Shift]]


### Formally

Easily graph sine by these steps
- Identify the amplitude
- Identify the period
- Identify the Interval

##### Multiplying X
If we are to multiply *x*; it changes the [[Periodic Function|period]] 

>We can multiply the period by the the value that is multiplying *x*

##### Addition or Subtraction to X
When we $\pm$ to *x* we simply add a [[Transformation of Graphs|horizontal shift]] to our basic ***sine*** graph

This called a [[Phase Shift]] 

 *Cosine* is a horizonal shift by $\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ of *Sine*

##### Principle Formula for Sine Function

$$
y = A\sin(Bx\pm C)\pm D
$$
$|A|$ = [[Amplitude|amplitude]]
$\frac{2\pi}{B}$ = [[Periodic Function|period]]
$0 \leq Bx-C \leq\pi$
D = [[Transformation of Graphs|Vertical shift]]
$\frac{C}{B}$ = [[Transformation of Graphs|Horizontal Shift]] or [[Phase Shift]]
