### Idea
Quantities that involve both magnitude and a direction are called **vector quantities**, or vectors for short
Quantities that involve magnitude, but no direction, are called scalar quantities, or scalars for short | *scalars are just real numbers*

#### Directed Line Segments
A line segments which a direction has been assigned is called a directed line segment. We call P the initial point and Q the terminal point. We denote this directed line segment by $|\vec{PQ}|$  or we can call it $\vec{|w|}$ which is a vector
*When we use the absolute value bars to denote the magnitude*

Vector are equal when both the magnitude and direction are the same 

We can use the [[Distance Formula]] to find the length of a vector
$||\vec{u}|| =\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2 +(y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$ 

##### Solving an equality of two vectors
You can find the distance of each line segment and see if each are equal

Show magnitude by distance formula
Slope: $m=\frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}$ 


##### Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
The multiplication of a real number *k* and a $\vec{v}$ is called scalar multiplication. We write is product $k \vec{v}$ 

Multiplying a vector only changes the magnitude of the vector not the direction.
$[0,1)$ the magnitude is getting smaller
$(1, \infty)$ the magnitude is getting larger

##### The Difference of Two Vectors
The difference of two vectors, **v**-**u**, is defined as **v-u=v+(-u)**, where **-u**

##### The i and j Unit Vectors
We use these letters to describe unit vectors.

As unit vectors they have the magnitude of 1

i is the vector along the positive x-axis
j is the vector along the positive y-axis

##### Representing Vectors in Rectangular Coordinates 
We can represent vectors as **i** and **j** and multiplied by scalars

$$
\vec{v} =a \vec{i} + b \vec{j}
$$

The sum of the two vectors is called a **linear** 

To find the magnitude $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }$ 

When solving vectors we always subtract the terminal point minus the origin point

###### Adding and Subtracting Vectors in Terms of i and j
If $\vec{v}=a_{1}i+b_{1}j$ and $\vec{w}=a_{2}+b_{2}j$ then
	$v+w=(a_{1}+a_{2}i+(b_{1}+b_{2}j)$ 
	$v-w=(a_{1}-a_{2}i+(b_{1}-b_{2}j)$
- Just collect *like* terms 

###### Scalar Multiplication with a Vector in Terms of i and j
If $\vec{v}=a \vec{i}+ b \vec{j}$ and $k$ is a real number, then the scalar is multiplication of the vector $v$ and the scalar $k$ is
		$k \vec{v}=(ka)\vec{i}+(kb)\vec{j}$ 


###### The Zero Vector
The vector whose magnitude is 0 is called the **zero vector, 0**, The zero vector is assigned no direction. It can also be expressed in terms of i and j

###### Properties of Vectors

All algebraic properties of addition, multiplication apply to vectors

###### Unit Vectors
A **unit vector** is defined to be a vector whose magnitude is one

**i and j** are unit vector but also nay vector whose magnitude is one is also a unit vector

For any nonzero vector **v**, the vector
$\frac{v}{||v||}$ is the unit vector that has the same direction as **v**. To find this vector, divide **v** by the magnitude.

###### Writing a Vector in Terms of Its Magnitude and Direction

$\vec{v}= ||\vec{v}||\cos\theta i+||\vec{v}||\sin\theta j$ 

We replace **b*** and **a*** with $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$ respectively.  


###### Change in vector $\Delta$

[[Vectors In Physics]]

$$
\Delta  \vec{v} = \vec{v_{2}} -\vec{v_{1}}
$$
