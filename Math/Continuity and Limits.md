### Idea

Continuity is defined as a function with no leaps or jumps.
	Piece wise functions are not continuous 
	Rational Functions are not continuous

Continuity at x=c can be destroyed by any one of the following conditions
1. The function is not defined at x=c
2. The limit of f(x) does not exist at x=c
3. The limit of f(x)exists at the x=c, but it is not equal to f(c)

A function is **continuous** at c when these conditions are met
1. f(c) is defined
2. $\lim_{ x \to c }f(x)$ exists
3. $\lim_{ x \to -c }f(x=f(c))$


Removeable continuity


### Formally

$$
f(x)= \frac{1}{x} \text{ is not continous}
$$
> Since f(0) is undefined it does not follow the rules of continuous functions
