### Idea

In a [[Polar Coordinate System]], we plot points using **radius** and **angle (in radians)**.

***Each ring represents one unit of radius, and one full rotation is $2\pi$ radians.***

To convert **polar coordinates** to **rectangular (Cartesian)** coordinates, use the following relationships:

$$
\begin{gather}
x = r\cos\theta \\
y = r\sin\theta \\
x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\
\tan\theta = \frac{y}{x} \quad \text{(be sure to check which quadrant the point lies in)}
\end{gather}
$$

#### Polar Equation

A **polar equation** is an equation where the variables are $r$ and $\theta$.

To convert a rectangular equation (in terms of $x$ and $y$) to a polar equation (in terms of $r$ and $\theta$), substitute:

- $x$ with $r\cos\theta$
- $y$ with $r\sin\theta$

Therefore:

**Just replace $x$ and $y$** using their polar equivalents.

#### Examples of Common Polar Graphs

Below are some classic examples of graphs in polar form:

---

**1. Circle (centered off origin)**  
$r = a\cos\theta$ or $r = a\sin\theta$  
- Circle with diameter $a$  
- Cosine: centered horizontally  
- Sine: centered vertically

**2. Line through the origin**  
$\theta = \text{constant}$  
- A straight line at a fixed angle  
- Example: $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ is a diagonal line at 45°

**3. Rose Curves**  
$r = a\cos(n\theta)$ or $r = a\sin(n\theta)$  
- If $n$ is **odd**, you get $n$ petals  
- If $n$ is **even**, you get $2n$ petals  
- Example: $r = 2\sin(3\theta)$ → 3 petals

**4. Lemniscates (figure-eight shape)**  
$r^2 = a^2\cos(2\theta)$ or $r^2 = a^2\sin(2\theta)$  
- Graphs form a figure-eight or infinity symbol centered at the origin

**5. Spiral of Archimedes**  
$r = a\theta$  
- As $\theta$ increases, the radius increases  
- This creates a spiral that moves outward from the pole  
→ [[Spiral Graphs]]

**6. Cardioid**  
$r = a(1 \pm \cos\theta)$ or $r = a(1 \pm \sin\theta)$  
- Heart-shaped graph  
- Touches the origin and has a maximum value at $r = 2a$
