### Idea

A function *f* is **periodic** if there exists a positive *p* such that
$$
f(t+p)=f(t)
$$
$$
p=\text{period}
$$
for all *t* in the domain of *f*. The smallest positive number *p* for which *f* is periodic is called the **period** of *f*

The **period** is how long it take for it to cycle all it's values
