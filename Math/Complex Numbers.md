### Idea

**Complex Numbers** are numbers with both **real** and **imaginary** parts.

The imaginary unit is defined as:

$$
i = \sqrt{ -1 }, \quad \text{so that} \quad i^2 = -1
$$

A complex number in **standard form** is:

$$
a + bi
$$

Where:
- $a$ is the **real part**
- $b$ is the **imaginary coefficient**  
- $bi$ is the **imaginary part**

→ [[Imaginary Numbers]]

#### Closure Property

Complex numbers are **closed** under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except division by 0).  
This means any arithmetic operation on complex numbers **always results in another complex number**.

→ [[Number Theory]]

#### Arithmetic on Complex Numbers

When performing operations, **combine like terms**:
- Real parts with real parts
- Imaginary parts with imaginary parts

For example:

$$
(2 + 3i) + (4 - 2i) = (2 + 4) + (3i - 2i) = 6 + i
$$

**Multiplication Rule**: Use distributive property, then simplify using $i^2 = -1$

Example:

$$
(1 + 2i)(3 + 4i) = 3 + 4i + 6i + 8i^2 = 3 + 10i - 8 = -5 + 10i
$$

→ [[Distributive Property]]

#### Complex Conjugates

The **conjugate** of $a + bi$ is $a - bi$.

Multiplying a complex number by its conjugate eliminates the imaginary part:

$$
(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2
$$

This is useful for **rationalizing** a denominator.

#### Example: Division with Conjugates

To divide complex numbers:

$$
\frac{2 + 3i}{3 - 5i}
$$

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

$$
\frac{2 + 3i}{3 - 5i} \cdot \frac{3 + 5i}{3 + 5i} = \frac{(2 + 3i)(3 + 5i)}{(3 - 5i)(3 + 5i)}
$$

Simplifies to:

$$
\frac{-9 + 19i}{34} = -\frac{9}{34} + \frac{19}{34}i
$$

Always split the result into real and imaginary parts.

#### Principal Square Root of a Negative Number

For any positive real number $b$, the **principal square root** of $-b$ is:

$$
\sqrt{ -b } = i \sqrt{ b }
$$



---

### Summary of Operations

#### Addition/Subtraction

$$
(a + bi) \pm (c + di) = (a \pm c) + (b \pm d)i
$$

#### Multiplication

$$
(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
$$

#### Division (by Conjugate)

$$
\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{c^2 + d^2}
$$
