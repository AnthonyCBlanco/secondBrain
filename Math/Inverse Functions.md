### Idea

Inverse functions are functions but the ***x*** and ***y*** values swap

Functions that have an inverse that pass a vertical line test, the function is called one-to-one\

If the point (a, b) is one the graph of $f$ then (b, a) has to be in the graph $f^-1$

Inverse functions are reflections across the line $y=x$ 
So just a diagonal line going through the origin

With composites of functions, the value will always return **x** if the **x** is within the domain of the inverse function
### Formally


$$
f(x) = 2x+1
$$
Inverse
$$
f^-1(x)=\frac{x-1}{2}
$$
