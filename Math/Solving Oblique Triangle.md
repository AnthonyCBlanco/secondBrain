### Idea

We can use [[The Law of Sines]] to solve [[Oblique Triangles]] is which one side and two angles are known. We can only solve triangles that provide SAA or ASA. (Side, Angle, Angle) or (Angle, Side, Angle)

For [[Oblique Triangles]] the same rule applies that all angles must = 180 degrees
However we can not use the Pythagorean theorem to solve [[Oblique Triangles]]  

If solving a triangle and given SSA(Side, Side, Angle) it is know as ambiguous case when using [[The Law of Sines]] 

- If *a* is greater than h and a is greater than b. One triangle is formed

- If a=h and is just the right length to form a right triangle

- If a is less than h and is not long enough to form a triangle

- If a is a greater than h and  a less than b. Two district triangle can form 

>If the sine of an angle is not within the range of the sine function then you get no solution

For the area of a triangle: we can write it as such.
$$
Area= \frac{1}{2}bc\sin A \text{ for any Oblique Triangle}
$$
