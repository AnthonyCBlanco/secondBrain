### Idea

To verify an identity, we show that once side of the identity can be simplified so that is is identical to the other side. Each side of the equation is manipulated independently of the other side of the equation. Start with the side containing the more complicated expression. If you substitute one or more of the fundamental identities on the more complicated side, you will often be able to rewrite it in a form identical to that of the other side

>We work with the more complicated expression and keep the other side the same

Unlike algebra, to verify an identity we only work with one side on an equation

We can use [[Trigonometric Identities]] to substitute terms until we find our way back to our original equation 

### Formally

$$\begin{gather}
\text{Verify} \\
\csc x\tan x=\sec x \\
\csc x\tan x=\frac{1}{\sin x}* \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \\
=\frac{1}{\cos x} \\
=\sec x
\end{gather}
$$
