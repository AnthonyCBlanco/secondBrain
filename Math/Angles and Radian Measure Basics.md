***
	An angle is formed by two rays that have a common end-point


	On a Cordinate Plane, angles that termanate on an axix are called quadental

***

	Clock-wise angles are negative
	Counterclock-wise angles are positve

$$ \Theta = \frac{s}{r}
$$
$$
C = 2\pi r 
$$
$$S = r\Theta 
$$

***

$$
r = \text{Radius of Circle}
$$
$$
\Theta = \text{Angle In Radians}
$$
$$
S =  \text{Intercepted arc length}
$$

$$
180 \degree = \pi \text{ radians}
