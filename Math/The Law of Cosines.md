### Idea

We can use [[The Law of Cosines]] to find and solve [[Solving Oblique Triangle|Oblique Triangles]]. Similar to [[The Law of Sines]]

The Law of Cosines allows us to solve triangles in which we are only given SAS(Side, Angle, Side), or SSS(Side, Side, Side)


$$\begin{gather}
a^2= b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A \\
b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos A \\
c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C
\end{gather}

$$
> The square of a side of a triangle equals the sim of the squares of the other two side minus twice their product times the cosine of their included angle

We can derive a similar formula for finding the angles of a triangle where we are given 3 sides or SSS(Side, Side, Side)

$$
\cos A=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}
$$
