### Idea

In a [[Polar Coordinate System]], we plot points in terms of **radius** and **angle (in radians)**.

***Each ring represents one unit of radius, and one full rotation is $2\pi$ radians.***

To convert **polar coordinates** to **rectangular (Cartesian)** coordinates, use the following relationships:

$$
\begin{gather}
x = r\cos\theta \\
y = r\sin\theta \\
x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\
\tan\theta = \frac{y}{x} \quad \text{(check the quadrant to find the correct angle)}
\end{gather}
$$

#### Polar Equation

A **polar equation** is an equation whose variables are $r$ and $\theta$.

See also: [[Graph of Polar Equations]]

To convert a rectangular equation (in terms of $x$ and $y$) to a polar equation (in terms of $r$ and $\theta$), replace:

- $x$ with $r\cos\theta$
- $y$ with $r\sin\theta$

So:

**Just replace $x$ and $y$** using their polar equivalents.
